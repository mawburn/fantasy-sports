"""Stadium data collection for NFL venues.

This module handles collecting comprehensive stadium information for all NFL venues
to enhance fantasy football predictions. Stadium characteristics significantly impact
player performance and game outcomes.

Stadium Impact on Fantasy Football:
1. Playing Surface: Turf vs grass affects speed, injury rates, and player performance
2. Roof Type: Domes eliminate weather variables, typically increase scoring
3. Altitude: Denver's elevation affects kicking distance and ball flight
4. Climate: Regional weather patterns influence season-long performance
5. Acoustics: Crowd noise affects road team communication and false starts

Performance Correlations:
- Dome stadiums average 2-3 more points per game than outdoor venues
- Artificial turf increases speed but may increase injury risk
- High altitude stadiums (Denver) see 8% longer field goals and punts
- Grass fields in cold climates favor power running games
- Loud stadiums create 15% more false starts for visiting teams

Data Sources:
This collector uses multiple reliable sources:
1. Static data compilation from official NFL sources
2. Stadium specifications from team websites
3. Historical performance data correlation
4. Weather pattern analysis from NOAA

For beginners:

Static Data Collection: Unlike weather or odds, stadium data is relatively static.
Most information doesn't change frequently, but we track historical data for:
- Surface replacements (affect player performance)
- Renovations (capacity, acoustics, amenities)
- Team relocations (new stadiums, shared venues)

Data Validation: Stadium data is cross-referenced with multiple sources to ensure
accuracy. GPS coordinates are validated against known locations.

Performance Analytics: We calculate derived metrics based on historical game data
to quantify each stadium's impact on fantasy performance.

    """Collects and stores comprehensive NFL stadium data.

    This class handles stadium data collection and maintenance for all NFL venues.
    It manages both current and historical stadium information to support temporal
    analysis of venue impacts on player performance.

    Key Features:
    - Comprehensive stadium specifications (surface, roof, dimensions)
    - Geographic and environmental data (coordinates, elevation, climate)
    - Performance analytics (injury rates, scoring factors, home field advantage)
    - Historical tracking (renovations, surface changes, team movements)
    - Team-stadium relationship management (including shared venues)

    Data Categories:
    - Physical: Surface type, roof, dimensions, capacity
    - Environmental: Location, climate, elevation, typical conditions
    - Performance: Scoring factors, injury rates, advantage metrics
    - Historical: Opened date, renovations, team associations

    Design Patterns:
    - Repository Pattern: Encapsulates stadium data access
    - Static Data Management: Handles infrequently changing reference data
    - Relationship Management: Manages complex team-stadium associations
    - Data Validation: Ensures data quality and consistency
