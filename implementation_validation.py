Implementation validation and documentation for NFL DFS system.

This script provides comprehensive validation of the NFL Daily Fantasy Sports
system implementation without requiring external dependencies or database connections.
It uses Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing to analyze code structure
and verify that all required components are properly implemented.

Why Implementation Validation?

1. Code Quality Assurance: Verify that all expected functions, classes, and methods exist
2. Architecture Compliance: Ensure the implementation matches the planned system design  
3. Development Progress: Track what components have been implemented vs planned
4. Regression Detection: Catch when refactoring accidentally removes required functionality
5. Onboarding Aid: Help new developers understand system structure and completeness

Key Validation Categories:

- Database Models: SQLAlchemy models for NFL data (players, teams, games, statistics)
- API Endpoints: FastAPI routes for data access and predictions
- Feature Engineering: ML feature extraction pipeline
- Data Collection: NFL data gathering and processing
- CLI Interface: Command-line tools for system management

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Analysis:
This script uses Python's `ast` module to parse Python source code into a tree
structure representing the code's syntax. This allows us to extract information
about classes, functions, imports, and other code elements without executing
the code or requiring its dependencies to be installed.

For beginners: Think of AST analysis as reading the "table of contents" of
a program - we can see what's there without actually running it.

Usage:
    python implementation_validation.py
    
This generates a comprehensive report of system implementation status.

def analyze_python_file(file_path: Path) -> Dict:
    """
    Analyze a Python file and extract comprehensive structural information.
    
    This function uses Python's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module to parse
    source code and extract metadata about the code structure without executing it.
    This is safer and faster than importing modules, and works even when
    dependencies aren't installed.
    
    AST Analysis Process:
    1. Read the source code as text
    2. Parse text into an AST tree structure
    3. Walk through all nodes in the tree
    4. Extract classes, functions, and imports
    5. Return structured information about the code
    
    What We Extract:
    - Classes: Names, methods, line numbers
    - Top-level functions: Names and locations  
    - Imports: All imported modules and functions
    - Code size: Total lines for complexity estimation
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path object pointing to the Python file to analyze
        
    Returns:
        Dict containing:
        - 'classes': List of class info (name, methods, line number)
        - 'functions': List of function info (name, line number)
        - 'imports': List of all imported modules/functions
        - 'lines': Total lines of code (complexity indicator)
        - 'error': Error message if analysis failed
        
    For beginners: This is like creating an index or summary of a Python file
    showing what classes and functions it contains, similar to how you might
    skim a book's table of contents to understand its structure.

def validate_api_structure():
    """
    Validate the FastAPI application structure and endpoint implementation patterns.
    
    This validation goes beyond just checking if endpoints exist - it analyzes
    the quality and completeness of the API implementation by examining:
    
    API Quality Metrics:
    1. Endpoint Distribution: Balance of GET/POST/PUT/DELETE operations
    2. Response Models: Proper Pydantic model usage for consistent responses
    3. Dependencies: Database session injection and other dependencies
    4. Query Parameters: Rich filtering and pagination capabilities
    5. Documentation: Self-documenting API with proper parameter descriptions
    
    FastAPI Best Practices:
    - All endpoints should have response_model defined for automatic docs
    - Database dependencies should use Depends(get_db) for session management
    - Query parameters should have validation and documentation
    - HTTP status codes should be appropriate for each endpoint type
    
    Why API Structure Matters:
    - Consistency: Users can predict how to use new endpoints
    - Documentation: Automatic OpenAPI docs generation
    - Validation: Type safety and input validation
    - Performance: Proper dependency injection and caching
    - Maintainability: Clear patterns make debugging easier
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if API follows proper FastAPI patterns
