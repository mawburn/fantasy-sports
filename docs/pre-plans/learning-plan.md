# PyTorch Learning Plan for DFS Machine Learning

## Overview

This learning plan is designed to take you from PyTorch beginner to building sophisticated sports
prediction models. Each phase builds practical skills while working toward your goal of accurate DFS
predictions.

## Phase 1: PyTorch Fundamentals (Weeks 1-2)

### Core Concepts to Master

#### Tensors - The Foundation

**What**: Multi-dimensional arrays (like enhanced numpy arrays) that can run on GPU **Why
Important**: All data in PyTorch becomes tensors - player stats, predictions, model weights
**Learn**:

- Creating tensors from your NFL data
- Basic operations (add, multiply, reshape)
- Moving between CPU and GPU
- Converting between pandas DataFrames and tensors

#### Automatic Differentiation

**What**: PyTorch automatically calculates gradients (slopes) for optimization **Why Important**:
This is how neural networks learn - by adjusting weights based on gradients **Learn**:

- `tensor.requires_grad = True` - tells PyTorch to track operations
- `loss.backward()` - calculates all gradients automatically
- `optimizer.step()` - updates model weights using gradients

#### Basic Neural Network Layers

**What**: Building blocks like `nn.Linear` (fully connected layers) **Why Important**: These layers
learn relationships in your NFL data **Learn**:

- `nn.Linear(input_size, output_size)` - maps features to predictions
- `nn.ReLU()` - activation function that adds non-linearity
- `nn.Dropout()` - prevents overfitting by randomly zeroing some neurons

### Hands-On Projects

1. **Convert NFL CSV to tensors** - Practice data loading and conversion
1. **Build simple 2-layer network** - Predict fantasy points from basic stats
1. **Manual training loop** - Understand forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation

### Success Criteria

- Can load your NFL data into PyTorch tensors
- Understand what each line in a training loop does
- Built and trained your first neural network (even if inaccurate)

## Phase 2: Model Architecture & Training (Weeks 3-4)

### Advanced Architecture Concepts

more complex patterns **Experiment With**:

- 3-layer vs 5-layer vs 8-layer networks
- Hidden layer sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256 neurons
- Finding the sweet spot between complexity and overfitting

#### Regularization Techniques

**What**: Methods to prevent overfitting (memorizing training data) **Why Important**: Your model
needs to work on new, unseen games **Learn**:

- **Dropout**: Randomly disable neurons during training
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalize inputs to each layer
- **Weight Decay**: Penalize large weights in loss function

#### Loss Functions for Regression

**What**: How you measure prediction errors **Why Important**: Different loss functions optimize for
different goals **Experiment With**:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Standard choice, penalizes large errors heavily
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Less sensitive to outliers
- **Huber Loss**: Combination of MSE and MAE
- **Custom DFS Loss**: Penalize errors on high-priced players more

### Training Optimization

#### Optimizers

**What**: Algorithms that update model weights based on gradients **Learn**:

- **Adam**: Usually best starting point, adaptive learning rates
- **SGD**: Simple but sometimes more stable
- **AdamW**: Adam with better weight decay handling

#### Learning Rate Scheduling

**What**: Adjusting learning rate during training **Why Important**: Start with larger steps, then
fine-tune with smaller steps **Techniques**:

- **Step decay**: Reduce learning rate every N epochs
- **Cosine annealing**: Smoothly reduce learning rate
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduce when validation loss stops improving

### Hands-On Projects

1. **Architecture comparison** - Test 3-layer vs 5-layer vs 8-layer networks
