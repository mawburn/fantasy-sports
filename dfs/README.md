uv run python run.py collect --seasons 2022 2023 2024

# 2. Collect weather data (optional, batch-optimized for enhanced predictions)
uv run python run.py weather --historical

# 3. Train models
uv run python run.py train --positions QB RB WR TE DEF

# 4. Build optimal lineups (includes predictions automatically)
uv run python run.py optimize --strategy balanced --count 3

# Or save predictions too
uv run python run.py optimize --strategy balanced --count 3 --save-predictions predictions.csv
```

### Hyperparameter Tuning (NEW!)

The system now includes automated hyperparameter optimization to maximize model performance:

#### Learning Rate Optimization

Find the optimal learning rate using the LR Range Test method:

```bash
# Find optimal LR for all positions
uv run python run.py train --tune-lr

# Position-specific LR tuning
uv run python run.py train --positions QB --tune-lr

# Multiple positions
uv run python run.py train --positions QB RB WR --tune-lr
```

**How it works:**

- Starts with very small LR (1e-8) and exponentially increases
- Tracks loss vs learning rate curve
- Identifies steepest decline point (fastest learning)
- Applies safety factor for stability
- Expected improvement: 10-20% better RÂ² scores

#### Batch Size Optimization

Find the optimal batch size considering memory constraints:

```bash
# Optimize batch size for memory efficiency
uv run python run.py train --tune-batch-size

# Position-specific batch size tuning
uv run python run.py train --positions RB --tune-batch-size

# Multiple positions
uv run python run.py train --positions WR TE --tune-batch-size
```

**How it works:**

- Binary search for maximum memory-feasible batch size
- Tests performance across different batch sizes
- Balances memory usage with gradient quality
- MPS/CUDA/CPU aware optimization
- Expected improvement: 5-15% training speed boost

#### Full Hyperparameter Optimization

Use Optuna for Bayesian optimization of all hyperparameters:

```bash
# Full optimization with 20 trials (default)
uv run python run.py train --tune-all

# More thorough search with 50 trials
uv run python run.py train --tune-all --trials 50

# Position-specific optimization (RECOMMENDED)
uv run python run.py train --positions QB --tune-all

# Multiple positions with custom trials
uv run python run.py train --positions QB WR --tune-all --trials 30

# Focus on complex models that benefit most
uv run python run.py train --positions QB RB --tune-all --trials 50
```

**Optimized parameters:**

- Learning rate (log scale: 1e-6 to 1e-2)
- Batch size (16, 32, 64, 128, 256)
- Hidden layer sizes (position-specific ranges)
- Dropout rates (0.1 to 0.5)
- Number of layers (1 to 4)

**Expected improvement:** 15-30% overall performance gain

#### Manual Override

Use specific hyperparameters discovered through tuning:

```bash
# Use previously found optimal values
uv run python run.py train --lr 0.0023 --batch-size 96

# Combine with position selection
uv run python run.py train --positions QB RB --lr 0.001 --batch-size 64
```

#### Testing and Validation

Test the hyperparameter tuning system:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py

# Test specific methods
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --method lr      # LR finder only
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --method batch   # Batch size only
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --method joint   # Optuna only
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --method ab      # A/B testing
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --method cv      # Cross-validation

# Test specific position
uv run python test_hyperparameter_tuning.py --position QB --method all
```

#### Best Practices

1. **Start with LR tuning** - Often provides the biggest immediate gain
2. **Run batch size optimization** - Especially important for memory-limited systems
3. **Use full optimization sparingly** - Takes significant time but provides best results
4. **Save optimal parameters** - Record best values for production use
5. **Validate improvements** - Use A/B testing to confirm gains

#### Position-Specific Recommendations

- **QB**: Focus on learning rate (complex architecture benefits most)
  ```bash
  uv run python run.py train --positions QB --tune-all --trials 30
  ```
- **RB**: Joint optimization recommended (proven baseline to improve)
  ```bash
  uv run python run.py train --positions RB --tune-all --trials 20
  ```
- **WR/TE**: Batch size optimization (simpler models, memory efficiency)
  ```bash
  uv run python run.py train --positions WR TE --tune-batch-size
  ```
- **DST**: Skip neural network tuning (uses CatBoost which self-tunes)
  ```bash
  uv run python run.py train --positions DST  # No tuning needed
  ```

#### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Tune QB model (most complex, benefits most from tuning)
uv run python run.py train --positions QB --tune-all --trials 30 --epochs 50

# Step 2: Tune RB model
uv run python run.py train --positions RB --tune-all --trials 20

# Step 3: Quick tune for WR/TE (simpler models)
uv run python run.py train --positions WR TE --tune-lr --tune-batch-size

# Step 4: Train DST without tuning (CatBoost self-optimizes)
uv run python run.py train --positions DST

# Alternative: Tune all neural network positions at once
uv run python run.py train --positions QB RB WR TE --tune-all --trials 15
```

### Injury Status Management

The system supports manual injury status tracking to adjust player projections:

```bash
# Update injury statuses from CSV file
uv run python run.py injury --csv data/injuries.csv

# Update individual players manually
uv run python run.py injury --player "Patrick Mahomes" Q --player "Justin Jefferson" OUT

# Use injury file when generating predictions
uv run python run.py predict --contest-id <id> --injury-file data/injuries.csv --output predictions.csv

# Include injuries when optimizing lineups
uv run python run.py optimize --contest-id <id> --injury-file data/injuries.csv --strategy balanced
```

**CSV Format** (save as `data/injuries.csv`):

```csv
player_name,injury_status
Patrick Mahomes,Q
Justin Jefferson,OUT
Christian McCaffrey,D
```

**Injury Status Codes & Impact**:

- **Q** (Questionable): 85% projection, 75% floor, 90% ceiling
- **D** (Doubtful): 40% projection, 20% floor, 50% ceiling
- **OUT**: 0% all projections (excluded from lineups)
- **IR** (Injured Reserve): 0% all projections
- **PUP** (Physically Unable to Perform): 0% all projections
- **PPD** (Game Postponed): 0% all projections

### Optimization Strategies

The system offers different optimization strategies for different contest types:

#### **Balanced** (Default)

- Uses raw projected points for optimization
- Good for general purpose lineups
- No specific adjustments for ceiling/floor or ownership
- Best for: Mixed contests, testing, general use

#### **Tournament** (GPP/Large Field)

- Emphasizes high ceiling players over consistent scorers
- Automatically enables QB-WR stacking for correlation
- Targets players with 25+ point upside potential
- Best for: Large tournaments where you need to differentiate

#### **Cash** (Head-to-Head/50-50s)

- Prioritizes floor and consistency over ceiling
- Uses conservative 80% of projection for safety
- Avoids boom/bust players
- Best for: Cash games where you need to beat ~50% of field

#### **Contrarian**

- Penalizes high-ownership players to find unique lineups
- Good for tournaments when you want to be different
- Reduces player values based on projected ownership
- Best for: Large tournaments with ownership data

### Betting Odds Collection

The system can collect live betting odds from The Odds API to enhance predictions with market expectations:

```bash
# Collect odds for specific date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
uv run python run.py odds --date 2025-09-07

# Collect odds for all upcoming games
uv run python run.py odds
```

**Setup Requirements:**

1. Get a free API key from [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com/) (500 requests/month free)
2. Set `ODDS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here` in your `.env` file

**Features:**

- **Market data**: Point spreads, over/under totals, and moneylines from major US sportsbooks
- **Automatic matching**: Links odds to games in your DraftKings salary data
- **Smart handling**: Creates minimal game records for upcoming games to satisfy database constraints
- **Multiple sportsbooks**: Aggregated from DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, and others
- **Source tracking**: Distinguishes between different data sources (odds_api vs spreadspoke)

**API Usage:**

- **Free tier**: 500 requests per month
- **Data coverage**: NFL regular season and playoffs
- **Update frequency**: Real-time odds with live line movements
- **Historical support**: Limited historical odds data available

The system automatically integrates betting odds into your feature engineering pipeline, providing market consensus that can improve prediction accuracy.

### Weather Data Collection

Weather data can enhance predictions for outdoor stadium games. The weather command uses the Visual Crossing Weather API with intelligent batch processing:

```bash
# Collect all weather data (historical + upcoming) - RECOMMENDED
uv run python run.py weather

# Collect only historical weather data for training
uv run python run.py weather --historical

# Collect only upcoming weather data for current contests
uv run python run.py weather --upcoming
```

**Batch Processing Benefits:**

- **10x more efficient**: Groups games by stadium and date ranges
- **Fewer API calls**: 1 call can fetch weather for 30 games at same stadium
- **Smart batching**: Processes 30-day chunks per stadium location
- **Incremental**: Only collects missing weather data, resumes where left off

**API Limits (Visual Crossing Free Tier):**

- **1000 requests/day** - resets daily
- **No standard rate limit headers** returned
- **Batch vs individual requests**: Same API cost (1 query per call)

**System Features:**

- Automatically detects rate limits and daily quota exceeded
- Only processes outdoor stadiums (skips domes: ATL, DAL, HOU, etc.)
- Resumes where it left off if interrupted
- Logs progress every 20 successful weather records

### Advanced Usage
