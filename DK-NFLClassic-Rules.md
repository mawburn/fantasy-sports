# NFL Classic — DraftKings Rules & Settings

In salary cap contests, participants will create a lineup by selecting players listed in the Player Pool. Contest results are determined by the total points accumulated by each individual lineup entry (scoring rules summarized below). Participation must follow the Terms of Use; violations may result in disqualification and, if applicable, prize forfeiture.

## Player Pool

The Player Pool consists of all NFL players expected to be on the active roster for any team scheduled to play in the contest’s **Game Set**. Players may occasionally be missing due to trades or other unforeseen circumstances. Each player has an assigned salary and a valid lineup must not exceed the **$50,000** salary cap.

Because rosters are fluid, DraftKings may adjust player pools after contests are available. Additional players may be added up to **48 hours before a Game Set’s lock**. This may render previous valid lineups invalid; affected entrants will be notified via email.

A **Game Set** is a set of games used for contests; each contest is tied to one Game Set. Contests in the same Game Set can be created at different times; policies are based on the timing of the Game Set’s availability, not each individual contest.

______________________________________________________________________

## Position Eligibility

Player positions are determined at the **sole discretion of DraftKings**.

______________________________________________________________________

## Lineup Edits

Lineups may be edited any time leading up to games. Each individual player becomes **locked** at the scheduled start time of their team’s game. A locked player cannot be added or removed from a roster spot. Locked roster spots for all entries are displayed in contest GameCenters.

If a scheduled start time changes after contests for a Game Set are available, DraftKings will take measures to reflect the change on Draft Screens and for lineup editing. If a game starts **before** the scheduled start time and our feed reflects that it has begun, all players in that game become locked. Any swaps made after the _real-life_ start time will result in those lineups being **disqualified and refunded**.

______________________________________________________________________

## Cancelled, Postponed, and Rescheduled Games

- If a game is cancelled or postponed & **rescheduled within the original Scoring Period** and the change is made **< 24 hours** before the Game Set’s start, the game remains in the Game Set and eligible players can accrue points.
- If a game is rescheduled to a time **outside the original Scoring Period** and the change is made **< 24 hours** before the Game Set’s start, the game will be **disabled** from the Game Set and players in that game will **not** be eligible to accrue points. Players you selected for your roster as of the **lock of the disabled game** will remain in your roster and will **accrue zero points**. Players in disabled games will become locked at the originally scheduled start time of their game.

**Scoring Period for NFL**: the timeframe between the scheduled start of the first game within the Game Set and **11:59 PM ET on the first Wednesday after** the last scheduled game within the Game Set.

If a game is postponed, DraftKings will decide **no later than 11:59 PM ET** on the day of the game how to handle the postponed game.

DraftKings may adjust the Scoring Period at its sole discretion to accommodate schedule changes to any time before **12:00 AM ET on the day after** the Game Set is scheduled.

Any disabled games will be indicated as such on Draft Screens. Emails and other notifications may be used to notify users of disabled games.

If cancelled or games rescheduled for a later date result in a Game Set including **only one active game**, all contests for that Game Set will be **cancelled and refunded**. If the changes result in a Game Set including **zero** active games, all contests will be **cancelled and refunded**.

**Known** cancellations/postponements are recognized once updated by DraftKings’ NFL stats provider, **STATS LLC**.

_Example:_ If a Game Set includes two games at 8:00 PM ET and 10:30 PM ET respectively, and the 10:30 PM ET game is officially postponed at 6:00 PM ET, then all contests for that Game Set are cancelled and refunded. If the 10:30 PM ET game is not officially postponed until after 8:00 PM ET, then contests for that Game Set are not cancelled and are played out using only the 8:00 PM ET active game.

______________________________________________________________________

## Suspended or Shortened Games

DraftKings uses **official NFL statistics** and only includes statistics from games the NFL deems to be official. If the NFL declares a game **suspended**, the statistics generated **before** suspension will count in Game Sets containing that game. Any statistics generated later when the game resumes are **not included**.

If a game is suspended due to an injury or other **“Act of God”** type instance (at DK’s sole discretion) and does **not** continue by the end of the Scoring Period (defined above), then:

1. **Multi‑game sets (Classic):** all stats accrued up to the time of stoppage **count** toward the set.
1. **Single‑game sets (Showdown):**
   - If the suspension occurs in the **first half**, the set will be **refunded**.
   - If the suspension occurs at **halftime or in the second half**, the set will be **paid out as scored** at the time of suspension.
